## Available KYC Verifications

    "bvn": "12345678901"
  }'
```

## Implementation Flow

### 1. Create Customer First

Before performing KYC verification, you need a customer ID:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.fossapay.com/api/v1/customers \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "phone": "+2348012345678"
  }'
```

### 2. Perform KYC Verifications

You can perform any combination of the available KYC checks. Each successful verification upgrades the customer's KYC level.

## Error Handling

Handle verification failures appropriately:

```javascript
// Example error responses
// 400 Bad Request - Invalid input
{
  "error": 400,
  "message": "Validation failed - invalid BVN format"
}

// 404 Not Found - Customer doesn't exist
{
  "error": 404,
  "message": "Customer not found"
}
```
