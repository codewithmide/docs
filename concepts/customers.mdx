## What are Customers?

Customers represent your end users within the Fossapay ecosystem. Every wallet, transaction, and compliance check is associated with a customer account.

<Info>
  Customer accounts are required before you can create wallets or perform transactions on behalf of your users.
</Info>

## Customer Lifecycle

### 1. Customer Creation
Create a customer account with basic information:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api-staging.fossapay.com/api/v1/customers \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "phone": "+2348012345678"
  }'
```

### 2. KYC Verification
Perform identity verification for compliance:

- **BVN Verification**: Bank Verification Number
- **NIN Verification**: National Identity Number
- **Address Verification**: Proof of address

### 3. Wallet Creation
Once verified, create wallets for the customer:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api-staging.fossapay.com/api/v1/wallets/fiat/create \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customerId": "cus_123456789",
    "walletName": "Main Wallet",
    "walletReference": "wallet_ref_001"
  }'
```

## Customer Tiers

Currently, Fossapay supports individual customer accounts. All customers are created with the `individual` tier.

<Note>
  Additional tiers (business, enterprise) will be available in future updates.
